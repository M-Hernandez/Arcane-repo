# Julia

Julia project focuses on the simulation of coordinate points given a .tsv file from Qualisys data.
41 points are currently visualized using MeshCat animations. Each marker is represented by a sphere in the visualizer.

This research was publicated in the 2020 11th IEEE Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference, [*An Initial Julia Simulation Approach to Material Handling Operations from Motion Captured Data*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9284829)
